# Sudoku Solver

This uses simulated annealing to solve a sudoku puzzle. The input is the sudoku puzzle as a 2D integer array, where the blank squares are replaced with 0s, and the output is the solved sudoku puzzle as a 2D array. I first heard about this technique from [this blog post](http://blog.pluszero.ca/blog/2016/07/17/using-simulated-annealing-to-solve-logic-puzzles/).

The program starts by creating an initial guess for the solution. The guess will always choose numbers uniquely from 1 to 9 for each 3x3 block in the grid. In each iteration, a new guess will be generated by mutating the current guess. Two numbers from the same 3x3 block will be swapped (ensuring the property that all numbers in the 3x3 block are unique). The cost of a board is measured by 162 minus the number of duplicated numbers in each column and row. If the cost of this new board is lower, the new board becomes the current best guess and we continue iterating. If the cost is higher, we will move to this worse board a certain percentage of the time. We have found the correct board once the cost reaches 0.
